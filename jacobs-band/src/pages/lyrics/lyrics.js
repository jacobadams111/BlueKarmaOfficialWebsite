      <h2>"Arrays In My Brain"</h2>
      <p>
        The truth it comes in waves, but I refuse to believe it so I don't
        <br></br>I just keep riding on this wave of hope <br></br>
        Sometimes it takes a little while for your heart to catch up <br></br>
        with what your mind already knows <br></br>
        Your mind already knows <br></br>I already know <br></br>I know, you
        know <br></br> <br></br>
        And all these days, they slip away to countless arrays inside my brain,{" "}
        <br></br>
        Inside my brain<br></br>
        Back to square one, I looked into the sun now my vision is getting
        blurry, <br></br>
        but I just can't look away<br></br>
        <br></br>
        And all these days looking out my window, I want to blow my brains out,
        <br></br>
        but I just don't have the nerve, or the time <br></br>
        Sometimes I wish that I could believe in God so that I could pray,
        <br></br>
        I'd do it all damn day<br></br>
        I'd do it all damn day<br></br>
        I'd do it all damn day<br></br>I know, you know<br></br>
        <br></br>
        And all these days, they slip away to countless arrays inside my brain,{" "}
        <br></br>
        Inside my brain<br></br>
        Back to square one, I looked into the sun now my vision is getting
        blurry, <br></br>
        but I just can't look away<br></br>
      </p>

      <h2>"Magnetic Girl"</h2>
      <p>
        Just one look into your eyes<br></br>
        Oh lord they are hypnotizing me<br></br>
        Oh please won't you set me free<br></br>
        From your magnetic energy<br></br>
        <br></br>
        Dressed in black with looks to kill<br></br>
        And I can't seem to get my fill<br></br>I think you'e got me under your
        spell<br></br>
        This could be heaven but it might be hell<br></br>
        <br></br>
        Magnetic girl<br></br>
        Your eyes take me to another dimension<br></br>
        Teeth made of pearl<br></br>
        You're pullin' me in, You're pullin' me in now<br></br>
        Magnetic girl <br></br>I know it's a sin, but I wanna jump in <br></br>
        To a whole nother world<br></br>
        You're pullin' me in, You're pullin' me in<br></br>
        <br></br>
        Just one look into your eyes<br></br>
        Oh lord they are hypnotizing me<br></br>
        Oh please won't you set me free<br></br>
        From your magnetic energy<br></br>
      </p>

      <h2>"Locked Out"</h2>
      <p>
        Why is it so easy for you?<br></br>I gave you my heart and now its
        turnin' blue<br></br>
        Why did you close the door?<br></br>I gave you my all but you wanted
        more<br></br>
        <br></br>
        I'm locked out<br></br>
        You threw away the key<br></br>I will never be free<br></br>
        Whatcha doin' to me?<br></br>
        I'm locked out<br></br>
        My heart is turnin' blue<br></br>
        Baby watcha gonna do <br></br>
        When I forget about you<br></br>
        <br></br>
        You said it all played out so naturally<br></br>
        My head says you're right, but my heart disagrees<br></br>I know by now
        nothing stays the same<br></br>
        I'm stuck thinking I'm the only one to blame<br></br>
        You tell me it's neither one of our faults<br></br>
        Your mind is locked tight just like a vault<br></br>
        Baby why won't you listen to me?<br></br>I think I'm locked out, I can't
        find the key<br></br>
        <br></br>
        (x2) <br></br>I'm locked out<br></br>
        You threw away the key<br></br>I will never be free<br></br>
        Whatcha doin' to me?<br></br>
        I'm locked out<br></br>
        My heart is turnin' blue<br></br>
        Baby watcha gonna do <br></br>
        When I forget about you<br></br>
        <br></br>
        Forget about you, Forget about<br></br>
        Forget about -bout you<br></br>
        Forget a-get about -bout you<br></br>
        <br></br>
        Forget about you, Forget about<br></br>
        Forget about you, Forget about, about -bout Forget about you<br></br>
        Forget about you, Forget about<br></br>
        Forget a-get about -bout you<br></br>
        Forget about, about, -bout you<br></br>
        Forget about you<br></br>
      </p>

      <h2>"On The Other Side"</h2>
      <p>
        I don't know what I'm doing tonight<br></br>
        Won't you come with me and we'll go for a ride<br></br>
        Take a break from the world for a while<br></br>
        Comfort fills my mind with every mile<br></br>
        Every mile, every mile<br></br>
        <br></br>
        If I don't come back, <br></br>
        I'll see you on the other side<br></br>
        No going back,<br></br>
        It's time for another ride<br></br>
        <br></br>
        On the other side you'll know what it means<br></br>
        Take a break from reality, find a dream<br></br>
        If the pavement starts to crack, don't go back<br></br>
        Trust the road will find the way back home<br></br>
      </p>

      <h2>"Something's Missing"</h2>
      <p>
        The past it slips away, like a bottle out at sea<br></br>
        My memory, ain't what it used to be<br></br>
        <br></br>
        Oh I don't know what's missing<br></br>I don't know whats missing
        <br></br>
        Oh I don't have a clue<br></br>
        <br></br>
        The past is just a dream, and it's slippin' out of sight<br></br>
        My vision starts to blur, I'm as high as a kite<br></br>
        <br></br>
        Oh my, my love has gone away now <br></br>
        My, my love has gone away now<br></br>
        Oh why am I still here? My, my life is passing by<br></br>
      </p>

      <h2>"Let Me Breathe"</h2>
      <p>
        Well I can't seem to mask this pain<br></br>
        My mind's in a blender, my heart is in the drain<br></br>
        I'm runnin' round in circles, I'm trying to explain<br></br>
        Things are never gonna be the same<br></br>
        <br></br>I can't go on like this<br></br>
        You're the one I really miss now<br></br>I thought I'd get a second
        chance<br></br>
        Now I'm stuck inside this trance of endless memories<br></br>
        Baby please, I need you now<br></br>
        Just look me in the eyes, one more time,<br></br>
        So I can breathe<br></br>
        <br></br>
        Why can't I seem to refrain?<br></br>
        From doing this over and over again<br></br>
        My mind is spinning round like a hurricane<br></br>
        How am I ever gonna break this chain?<br></br>
        <br></br>I can't go on like this<br></br>
        You're the one I really miss now<br></br>I thought I'd get a second
        chance<br></br>
        Now I'm stuck inside this trance of endless memories<br></br>
        Baby please, I need you now<br></br>
        Just look me in the eyes, one more time,<br></br>
        So I can breathe<br></br>
        <br></br>
        (I thought I'd get a second chance) <br></br>
        (I thought I'd get a second chance)<br></br>
      </p>
